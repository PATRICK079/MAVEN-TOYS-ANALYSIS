/*Since each location offers all 35 products, attention is
paid to individual stores.

An initial observation shows that not every store has 
offered all 35 products from January 2017 â€“ September 2018. 
Of the 50 stores, 40% of them offered only 30 products or less. 
One may assume that stores which offered every product will generally 
have more sales, but this is not necessarily the case. The top two 
selling stores, Ciudad de Mexico 2 ($554,553) and Guadalajara 3 ($449,354)
only offered 30 products. Additionally, of the top 10 selling stores,
5 of them offered only 30 products.

An observation of products reveals that of the 50 stores, 24 stores
did not offer the Monopoly product, 23 stores did not offer the Chutes
& Ladders product, 22 stores did not offer the Uno Card Game product, 
and 20 stores did not offer the Classic Dominoes as well as the Mini 
Basketball Hop product. Further analysis also shows that these items 
were among the worst 10 selling products, with none exceeding $100,000 
in sales.

Offering these additional products at stores may not significantly 
increase sales as these products were not proven to have great demand.*/
